# Curvetopia
Curvetopia transforms line art into cubic BÃ©zier curves using advanced algorithms. We read polylines from CSV files with NumPy, detect shapes (lines, circles, ellipses), identify symmetry (reflection, rotational), and complete curves using interpolation. Results are saved in SVG and PNG formats with svgwrite and cairosvg.
